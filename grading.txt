Grading:

-- Other --
- incorrect filename, would be an automatic 0 in university

-- Black Box Testing & Behaviour --

- sell_product() returns incorrect result during test
    - selling a valid number of existing product stock returns False
        - line 75, test_sell_product, a4_test.py
- list_products() does not work as described in the requirements
    - correctly prints out all products when given '*' argument
    - correctly prints out single product matching keyword in name
    - fails to print out single product matching keyword in description
    - fails to print out multiple products matching keyword in name & description
- main() function not included
- load_inventory() works correctly
- save_inventory() works correctly
- remove_product() works correctly
- add_product_stock() works correctly
- sell_product() works correctly


-- Implementation & Styling -- 

P1 (load_inventory): 
    - lingering comments need to be cleaned up
P2 (save_inventory):
    - spacing is weird
    - save_inventory re-opens the file and returns some value not asked for,
        please fix. -> use a test script if you want to validate
P3 (add_new_product):
    - very unclear method of checking that product exists in the product_list
        - it should not be comparing the input name with the name AND description. Just the name
        - the inner loop is not needed at all, just compare with the 0th index of product_list[x]
P4 (remove_product):
    - the inner loop is unnecessary, you don't need to compare with the description, just compare
        with the name

P5 (add_product_stock):
    - the inner loop is unnecessary, you don't need to compare with the description, just compare
        with the name

P6 (sell_product):
    - the inner loop is unnecessary, you don't need to compare with the description, just compare
        with the name

P7 (list_products):
    - print formatting doesn't look very clean and is hard to read, compact related data together
        in single paragraph
    - your implementation only works for finding a single keyword match only and does not keyword
        match the description
    - the inner loop is unnecessary...
    - you can write the implementation using a single loop

Overall:
    - make a helper function to check that the product name exists in the product list instead of 
        re-writing the code each time 
    - there are several unnecessary inner loops written that occur frequently, please fix
